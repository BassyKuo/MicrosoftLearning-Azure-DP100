    "# Creating a Batch Inferencing Service\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous labs, you used an Azure ML *pipeline* to automate the training and registration of a model, and you published a model as a web service for real-time *inferencing* (getting predictions from a model). Now you'll combine these two concepts to create a pipeline for *batch inferencing*. What does that mean? Well, imagine a health clinic takes patient measurements all day, saving the details for each patient in a separate file. Then overnight, the diabetes prediction model can be used to process all of the day's patient data as a batch, generating predictions that will be waiting the following morning so that the clinic can follow up with patients who are predicted to be at risk of diabetes. That's what you'll implement in this exercise."
